We are immigrants, workers, dreamers, and neighbors who have spent generations building a nation founded on participation, not passivity. Democracy is not a given—it is something we shape, protect, and renew through action. We are not bystanders to history. We get to govern. And now, as forces seek to undermine the systems we have built, it is up to us to ensure that power remains where it belongs: with the people. Change starts here, in our communities, in our states, from the ground up. Join us."
