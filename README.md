# We, The People

This is a template for a locally-driven democracy activism site, built using Quarto.  
You can fork this repository and update the information for your own city or congressional district.

## How to Customize  
1. Update the `_quarto.yml` file with your site's title and navigation structure.  
2. Edit the `.qmd` files in the `pages/` directory to reflect local issues and action steps.  
3. Deploy using GitHub Pages or another static hosting service.
